Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using ML


The fact that human life is dependent on the proper functioning of the heart is the driving force behind this research. The heart is a crucial part of our bodies, and heart disease has become the leading cause of death globally. With the increase in number of deaths among people due to heart diseases, it becomes an issue to be addressed.

Our project was under the guidance of Dr. Pawan Kumar Tiwari and Prof. Vineet Kansal. We built an online platform to predict the risk of heart attack in a patient.

This application takes age, BMI, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, heart rate and blood glucose levels as input to give the risk in percentage associated with having a heart attack in a patient in 10 years time.






Run Locally
To run this project, open the code file in vs code studio and then tap on the run all option.

To get the risk associated with heart attack, input the values of age, BMI, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, heart rate and blood glucose levels and then run the corresponding cell.
